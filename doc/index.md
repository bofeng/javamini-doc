## About JavaMini

JavaMini is an application built into the OYOclass platform which can be used to write Python code following the guidelines for the AP Computer Science A exam. It cannot do everything that can be done using the Java programming language. It is limited to simple standard input and output and the Java standard libraries. It is designed to allow you to run Java code in the browser, making storage and sharing your work easier.

You cannot use it to make user interfaces or games with dynamic input. All input must be entered into the small box at the bottom of the output window (where it says "Expand Standard Input/User Input") *before* running the program.

## Quick Start

Copy following example code to JavaMini editor then click the "Run" button:

* Say hello

```java
public class Hello{
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        System.out.println("Hello Java");
    }
}
```
